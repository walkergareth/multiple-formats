# multiple-formats

The files in this folder are intended to help people looking to
produce multiple output formats, including editable formats, from a
single LaTeX source file.

You probably want to start by looking at the PDF file; the other files
are to show you sample outputs from the conversion process.

You may be able to download all the files in a single ZIP file by
clicking on "<> Code" above the list of files, then "Download ZIP".
